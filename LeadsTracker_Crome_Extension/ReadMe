Here I have created a Chrome extension where one can save links of some browsing pages of their interest and revisit those pages easily. 
here is how to use: 
                  1. clicking on the "SAVE TAB" button will directly capture the link of the current tab and save that
                  2. or one can copy some link and paste that in the box given and click on the "SAVE INPUT" button.

Thank you.
